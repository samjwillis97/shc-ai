The command `httpcraft <api_name> <endpoint_name> --config <path>` works correctly and can execute real HTTP requests to configured endpoints. Configuration file search hierarchy fully implemented as per T2.3 specification. All tests passing.

Verbose mode prints detailed request and response information to stderr including timing. Dry-run mode displays request details without making HTTP calls and gracefully handles unresolved variables. Exit-on-http-error supports patterns like "4xx", "5xx", and specific codes like "401,403". All Phase 5 tests passing (16 unit tests + 9 integration tests).

Created `httpcraft completion zsh` command that outputs a complete ZSH completion script. Added hidden `--get-api-names` and `--get-endpoint-names` commands that dynamically fetch completion values from configuration files. The completion script supports all CLI options (--config, --var, --profile, --verbose, --dry-run, --exit-on-http-error) and provides contextual completion for API names and endpoint names. Error handling is graceful - completion commands silently fail if config is missing or malformed to avoid breaking tab completion. All Phase 6 tests passing (11 unit tests + 11 integration tests).

## Phase 8: Chains (Core Logic & Basic Data Passing)

- **Goal:** Implement core functionality for chained requests, including step execution and data passing.
- **Status:** [x]
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] **T8.1:** Define YAML structure for top-level `chains` section. Each chain has `vars` and `steps`. Each step has `id`, `call` (`api_name.endpoint_name`), and optional `with` (for `headers`, `params`, `pathParams`, `body` overrides).
  - [x] **T8.2:** Implement the `httpcraft chain <chain_name>` command.
  - [x] **T8.3:** Implement sequential execution of steps defined in a chain. For each step, resolve its `call` to an API/endpoint definition.
  - [x] **T8.4:** Implement `chain.vars` and their integration into variable resolution (precedence: CLI > Step `with` > `chain.vars` > Endpoint > ...).
  - [x] **T8.5:** Implement `step.with` overrides for `headers`, `params`, `pathParams`, and `body`. Step overrides have highest precedence and support variable resolution. PathParams enable URL parameter substitution (e.g., `{{userId}}` → actual values).
  - [x] **T8.6:** Store full request/response for each step.
  - [x] **T8.7:** Integrate a JSONPath library.
  - [x] **T8.8:** Implement variable substitution for `{{steps.*.response...}}`.

  - [x] **T8.11:** Default output for successful chain is last step's body.
- **Notes/Blockers:** All Phase 8 tasks completed successfully! Implemented complete chain execution system with:
  - **JSONPath Integration (T8.7):** Added jsonpath-plus library for powerful data extraction
  - **Step Variable Resolution (T8.8 & T8.9):** Full support for {{steps.stepId.response.*}} and {{steps.stepId.request.*}} with automatic JSON parsing
  - **Request/Response Storage (T8.6):** Complete request and response data stored for each step for future reference
  - **Chain Failure Handling (T8.10):** Chains halt immediately on any step failure (HTTP 4xx/5xx errors)
  - **Chain Output (T8.11):** Successful chains output the last step's response body
  - Enhanced ChainExecutor with step data passing to variable resolution, proper error handling, and comprehensive test coverage. Variable resolver now handles complex JSONPath expressions including array access (e.g., {{steps.getUsers.response.body[0].name}}) and nested object access. All chain functionality working correctly with 90+ tests passing. Ready to proceed to Phase 9.

  - [x] **T9.6:** Implement built-in dynamic variables.
  - [x] **T9.7:** Finalize and thoroughly test full variable precedence.
- **Notes/Blockers:** All Phase 9 tasks completed successfully! Implemented comprehensive modular import system for APIs and chains, plus global variable file loading with proper precedence integration. Added secret variable resolution with `{{secret.VAR_NAME}}` syntax that defaults to OS environment variables. Implemented secret masking functionality that replaces secret values with `[SECRET]` in verbose output, dry-run mode, and error messages. Added built-in dynamic variables including `{{$timestamp}}`, `{{$isoTimestamp}}`, `{{$randomInt}}`, and `{{$guid}}` that generate fresh values on each resolution. Finalized and thoroughly tested complete variable precedence system: CLI > Step with > Chain vars > Endpoint > API > Profile > Environment > Plugins. All functionality working correctly with 351 tests passing including comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new features.
